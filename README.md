 More detailed project information can be found [here](https://onlinedevices.org.uk/Raspberry_Pi_4_SBC_-_mecanum_4WD).

 The designs for the associated custom 3D printed components can be downloaded from [here](https://www.printables.com/model/75941-flexible-chassis-2wd-4wd-robot).

An earlier design for the custom PCB is currently used in this build, with images shown below, and the KiCAD design as gerber files can be downloaded from the 'PCB_design_files' folder.
